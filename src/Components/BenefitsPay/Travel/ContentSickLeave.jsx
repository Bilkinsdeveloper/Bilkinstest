                        At Bilkins Inc., we simplify travel reimbursement by offering up to $1,000 to cover the expenses of getting you to your assignment. How you choose to travel is entirely up to you.

                        Want to take your SUV on a road trip from Idaho to California for your first assignment? We can help with that. Just cover the gas and let us know how to reimburse youâ€”Venmo, perhaps?

                        For flight reimbursements, simply provide your flight itinerary, payment amount, and payment method. If you drive to your assignment, you can complete a mileage form. All documentation can be submitted electronically. Your travel reimbursement will be directly deposited on the first Friday of your assignment.
